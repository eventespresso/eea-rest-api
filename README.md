EE4 REST API
=========

An Event Espresso 4 addon for providing an RESTful interface for Event Espresso's data. If you are considering using this API, please <a href='http://eventespresso.com/developers/event-espresso-4-rest-api-survey/'>complete this survey</a> to help us make it better. 

Documentation, installation and usages guides are located on <a href='http://developer.eventespresso.com/docs/ee4-json-rest-api-documentation/'>developer.eventespresso.com/ee-plugin/ee4-json-rest-api/</a>

The master branch of this plugin should work with EE core 4.6.32 or higher.

This plugin also requires you have the master branch of <a href='https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API'>the WP API</a> active on your site. 

The general roadmap is:
<ul>
<li>Add support for editing and updating EE data (we may try to enforce data integrity, or just give authenticated users full access to their data) (on hold until the community lets us know there's a demand for it)</li>
<li>have SPCO-style endpoints for simplifying the reg process and handling more business logic (like sending emails, fetching the questions for registrations for specific events, etc.; also on hold until the community lets us know there is demand for it)</li></ul>

Please report any feedback, feature requests, bug reports, on general interest in <a href='https://github.com/eventespresso/eea-rest-api/issues'>the github issue tracker</a>.

An Event Espresso 4 plugin for providing an RESTful interface for Event Espresso's events data.

== Notice ==
This API has been deprecated as of Event Espresso 4.8.29, when the new EE4 REST API was added into Event Espresso 4 core. This new EE4 REST API in Event Espresso 4 Core requires WordPress 4.4 to operate. Also, the EE4 REST API in Event Espresso 4 Core can be run concurrently with this EE4 REST API Plugin. Please see http://developer.eventespresso.com/docs/ee4-rest-api-introduction/#Versioning_and_Backwards_Compatibility for more details 

== Description ==

A RESTful interface for accessing all Event Espresso event data (see: [Decaf](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-espresso-decaf/) or [Core](https://github.com/eventespresso/event-espresso-core), or [EventEspresso.com](http://eventespresso.com/pricing/?ee_ver=ee4)). That means you can build client-side javascript code, mobile apps, and programs in any language (and on any server) that can read data used in Event Espresso 4.

So what's great about the EE4 REST API and what can you do with it? Here's a start:

* The Event Espresso 4 API is compatible with Event Espresso 4 (not Event Espresso 3) 
* It's built using the [WordPress REST API (aka WP API)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/). That means many plugins that work with the WP API work with it too. WP API gives the EE4 REST API a solid foundation by handling authentication, providing endpoint discovery, and supplying lots of the "behind-the-scenes" code.
* It provides read access to all Event Espresso 4 data: events, tickets, datetimes, registrations, custom questions and answers, payment methods, and configuration data. Even Event Espresso 4 add-ons' data, like from the [Mailchimp Add-on](http://eventespresso.com/product/eea-mailchimp/) or the [People Add-on](http://eventespresso.com/product/eea-people-addon/), is available by default. If we've missed something [tell us in the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/eventespresso/eea-rest-api/issues/new)!
* It uses Event Espresso's [models system](http://developer.eventespresso.com/docs/model-querying/) for querying the database. This gives API clients nearly as much querying abilities as server-side plugins. 

Documentation, installation and usages guides are located on [developer.eventespresso.com/ee-plugin/ee4-json-rest-api/](http://developer.eventespresso.com/ee-plugin/ee4-json-rest-api/)

This plugin also requires you have the master branch of the WP API active on your site.

== Installation ==

* [Install WordPress on a server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress)
* [Install Event Espresso 4 on that server](https://eventespresso.com/wiki/installing-event-espresso/)
* [Install the WordPress API 1.2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) [(master branch on github when this was written)](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master)
* Install this Event Espresso REST API Addon by either:

 - By checking out the github eea-rest-api project contents into  wp-content/plugins/eea-rest-api directory and activate it, or 
 - download the latest zip of master branch, and uploading it to WordPress using the wordpress plugin uploader

If you still have questions about how to build your killer app that works with the EE4 REST API, [open a ticket on our Github repo](https://github.com/eventespresso/eea-rest-api/issues). We'll try our best to answer it, and improve our documentation too.

Also you should stay tuned to our developer-specific blog at [developer.eventespresso.com](http://developer.eventespresso.com/) so you'll know about any important changes regarding backwards compatibility or other developments.

And what if you're wanting to create/edit EE4 data over the API? Or have some other feature request? We want to focus on what matters most to you, so let us know! [Chime in on our Github repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/eventespresso/eea-rest-api/issues) to let us know it matters to you!

And if you do build something great with the EE4 REST API, consider listing it on our [3rd party Add-ons page](http://eventespresso.com/product/third-party-add-ons/).

== Other Notes ==

= Powering the EventSmart.com API =

In addition to being made available for all Event Espresso users, the Event Espresso REST API Add-on will also power the [Event Smart](https://eventsmart.com/) API. That means that Event Smart users will be able to do the same things with their event data on as they can with Event Espresso.

Event application developers who build applications for the Event Espresso API will also have the advantage of accessing the Event Smart users and event data. We invite application developers who use or consume event data to integrate their applications with the Event Espresso/Event Smart API. As has been mentioned before, if you create a great third-party extension/app for Event Espresso/Smart data we will do our best to introduce it to our event organizing and attendee audiences.
